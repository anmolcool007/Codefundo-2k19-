## Loopholes
- <b><u>Loophole-1:</b></u>  As the technology is advancing, we still rely on pen-paper based issue of Voter-Id card. There are also several cases where same person gets two voter Id cards of different polling booths on the other hand there are also cases where eligible citizens are not issued Voter Id Card due to repetetive and exhaustive process for the issue of Voter Id Card.
- <b><u>Loophole-2:</b></u>  There is no real time link (specially in rular areas) between Voter's presence and  him/her casting the vote, the process of casting a vote generally involves approximately 2 steps, first the verification of the voter, which is generally done by an officer. After verification, the officer lets the voter cast his/her vote. One of the drawback is that the officers in rural areas maybe corrupt and let a person impersonate another valid or dummy voter.
- <b><u>Loophole-3:</b></u>  Voters who are away from there hometown have to go through tedious process of changing there address in order to cast their vote, due to packed schedule one hesitates to go through this process which leads of low percentages of casted votes.
- <b><u>Loophole-4:</b></u>  Many times the profile of concerned candidates are not transparent to the Voters, which leads to wrong decisions finally giving precious votes to wrong person.
