## Loopholes
- <b><u>Loophole-1</b></u> As the technology is advancing, we still rely on pen-paper based issue of Voter-Id card. There are also several cases where same person gets two voter Id cards of different polling booths on the other hand there are also cases where eligible citizens are not issued Voter Id Card due to repetetive and exhaustive process for the issue of Voter Id Card.
